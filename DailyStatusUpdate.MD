Project Overview
Goal
The project aims to leverage SEC EDGAR data to build a financial data management and analytics platform. Key components include:

Database Backend: A PostgreSQL database hosted on Azure to store structured data like company metadata, filings, financials, and frame data from SEC APIs.
Python Backend: Scripts to automate data ingestion from bulk SEC EDGAR data and APIs, with a long-term goal of creating a REST API for scalable integration.
Excel Add-In: A task pane add-in to enable financial professionals to query, analyze, and interact with this data directly in Excel.
Web Integration (Future): Expansion into web apps for broader accessibility.
Today's Accomplishments
1. Database Setup
Server: Successfully connected to the Azure PostgreSQL server (sec-edgar-data).
Tables: Created tables (companies, filings, financials) with appropriate schema.
2. Data Ingestion
Bulk Data: Acquired and processed a company_tickers.json file containing metadata for 750,000+ companies.
CSV Conversion: Converted the JSON file into a CSV file (company_tickers.csv) for easier ingestion.
Upload Process:
Attempted direct SQL COPY from the CSV file.
Set up a Python script (upload_csv.py) to handle data uploads programmatically.
3. Python Development
Environment Setup:
Resolved some issues with Python installations and virtual environments.
Activated .venv and installed required dependencies (psycopg2, dotenv).
Script Updates:
Integrated .env for secure database credentials management.
Improved modularity and readability of ingestion scripts (main.py and upload_csv.py).
Current Status
Whatâ€™s Working
The PostgreSQL database is functional and accessible.
Data acquisition and transformation pipelines (JSON to CSV) are set up and verified.
Python scripts for database interactions are in place and logically sound.
Problems Encountered
psycopg2 Import Error:

Repeated DLL load failures (ImportError) despite reinstalling the package and verifying dependencies.
The root cause might be related to system-wide Python conflicts or a missing dependency on the Windows platform.
Azure Data Studio Issues:

Permission errors when running COPY commands from local files.
Difficulty in using Azure Data Studio for direct data ingestion.
Next Steps
Immediate Priorities for Tomorrow
Resolve psycopg2 Issue:

Consider switching to psycopg2-binary if psycopg2 continues to fail.
Revisit the Anaconda prompt or a WSL environment to isolate and test Python scripts.
Upload Data to companies Table:

Test upload_csv.py after resolving the import issue.
Alternatively, use Azure Data Studio to manually import data if Python scripts remain problematic.
Expand Ingestion:

Populate additional tables (filings, financials) with real data using SEC APIs.
Test functions like fetch_and_store_submissions and fetch_and_store_company_facts.
Improve Error Handling:

Add logging to Python scripts for better debugging.
Handle edge cases like duplicate data or malformed records.
Future Goals
Data Analytics:
Build Python scripts or SQL queries to generate insights from the data (e.g., revenue trends, filings summaries).
Excel Add-In:
Connect the database to the add-in for live querying.
Enhance the search and visualization features in the task pane.
REST API Development:
Begin designing a REST API to expose financial data for broader use cases.
Key Considerations
Azure Costs:
Keep an eye on data storage and query costs to avoid overspending credits.
Backup Strategy:
Regularly back up the database to prevent data loss.
Scalability:
Plan for efficient ingestion of large datasets to handle growing data needs.
